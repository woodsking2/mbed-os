 * \brief Lower all clocks to the lowest frequency possible (best effort).

 *             The fast RC clock (RCxxM) is the lowest but it does not make sense to use it if the
 *             system clock is the fast XTAL clock (XTALxxM) or the PLL. Thus, the lowest system
 *             clock setting will always be the fast XTAL clock (XTALxxM) if the current system
 *             clock is not the fast RC clock (RCxxM). If the PLL is on then the switch to the fast
 *             XTAL clock (XTALxxM) will be done without disabling the PLL. No block is informed
 *             about the change. If there is an active SPI or I2C transaction, it may fail.
 *
 *          2. Check which is the lowest AHB clock that can be used.
 *             For DA1468x: When a MAC is active, the lowest AHB clock is 16MHz. The frequency
 *             change will destroy any ongoing IR transaction.
 *
 *          Note: if the SysTick runs then it is the dg_configABORT_IF_SYSTICK_CLK_ERR setting that
 *          controls whether the switch will continue or it will be aborted.
 *
